## Data Analysis Using SQL

1. Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.
--> %sql SELECT COUNT(PRIMARY_TYPE) FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA;

2. List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.
--> %sql SELECT DISTINCT(COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME) FROM CENSUS_DATA where PER_CAPITA_INCOME < 11000;

3. List all case numbers for crimes involving minors?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)
--> %sql SELECT CASE_NUMBER FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA WHERE DESCRIPTION LIKE "%MINOR%";

4. List all kidnapping crimes involving a child?
--> %sql SELECT * FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA WHERE PRIMARY_TYPE LIKE "%KIDNAP%" AND DESCRIPTION LIKE "%CHILD%";

5. What kinds of crimes were recorded at schools?
--> %sql SELECT DISTINCT(PRIMARY_TYPE) FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA WHERE LOCATION_DESCRIPTION LIKE "%SCHOOL%";

6. List the average safety score for each type of school.
--> %sql SELECT "Elementary, Middle, or High School", AVG(SAFETY_SCORE) FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS;

7. List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line
--> %sql SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, PERCENT_HOUSEHOLDS_BELOW_POVERTY FROM CENSUS_DATA ORDER BY PERCENT_HOUSEHOLDS_BELOW_POVERTY DESC LIMIT 5;

8. Which community area is most crime prone?
--> %sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COUNT(COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER) FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER ORDER BY COUNT(COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER) DESC LIMIT 1;

9. Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index
--> %sql SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX = (SELECT MAX(HARDSHIP_INDEX) FROM CENSUS_DATA);

10. Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?
--> %sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = (SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER ORDER BY COUNT(COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER) DESC LIMIT 1);
