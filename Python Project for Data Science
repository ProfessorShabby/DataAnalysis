# Using the yfinance Library to Extract Stock Data
 ## Using the Ticker module we can create an object that will allow us to access functions to extract data. To do this we need to provide the ticker symbol for the stock, here the company is Apple and the ticker symbol is AAPL
   apple = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
   !wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/data/apple.json

 ## Using the attribute info we can extract information about the stock as a Python dictionary.
    import json
with open('apple.json') as json_file:
    apple_info = json.load(json_file)
apple_info

 ## A share is the single smallest part of a company's stock that you can buy, the prices of these shares fluctuate over time. Using the history() method we can get the share price of the stock over a certain period of time. Using the period parameter we can set how far back from the present to get data. The options for period are 1 day (1d), 5d, 1 month (1mo) , 3mo, 6mo, 1 year (1y), 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, and max.
